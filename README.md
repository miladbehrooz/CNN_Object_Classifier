# Classification of different objects utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Implemented basic algorithms in ANN (e.g. FFN and backpropagation) from scratch for educational purposes
- Generated  100 images of 4 different objects (pen, highlighter, tomato, apple) plus 160 images for 'empty' class utilizing this [python script](https://github.com/bonartm/imageclassifier)
- Built and evaluated a CNN from scratch using TensorFlow and Keras and built and evaluated a CNN based on the MobileNet CNN using the transfer learning approach
- Developed a script to real-time predict objects held into the camera

## Usage
- Run real-time predictor with: ``` python codes/real_time_detector.py```
